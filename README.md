I created this utility for personal use. It allows you to generate an archive from files that are automatically grouped into directories based on their file extensions.

To build the executable, clone the repository and run go build (for example: go build -o go-squeeze.exe cmd/main.go).

The utility provides several commands, which you can view by running the executable with the --help flag.
